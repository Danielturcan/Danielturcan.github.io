        <h1id="you">Enduro in its most basic definition is a type of mountain bike racing where the downhills are timed, and the uphills are not. Riders are timed in stages that are primarily downhill, with neutral transfer stages in between.</h1>
        
        <h1> Downhill bike </h1>
         <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SMfGZbhHlTQ/maxresdefault.jpg" width="250" height="200">
        <h1id="dh-bike">A downhill bike (also known as a downhill mountain bike) is a full suspension bicycle designed for downhill cycling on particularly steep, rocky trails. Unlike a typical mountain bike, durability and stability are the most important design features, compared to lighter, more versatile cross-country bikes.</h1>
        <h1> Cross country bike </h1>
        <img src="https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/10/Niner-RKT-9-RDO-side-on.jpg " width="250" height="200" >
        <h1id="hello">Cross-country cycling is defined by the terrain on which it is performed. XC courses and trails consist of a mix of rough forest paths and singletrack (also referred to as doubletrack depending on width), smooth fireroads, and even paved paths connecting other trails.</h1>
